// platform/story/story-contract.ts — THE T1 STORY PRIMITIVES (N.WB1 · N.md §4.B1).
//
// The spine primitives the charter's story facility is built from (C6): the transition EDGE
// (`BeatTransitionSpec`/`EdgeSpec`), the beat's declarative FOCUS (`FocusEffect`), the figure's
// morph-participation seam (`MarkStageHandle`), and the two optional chapter facets
// (`ChapterChoreography`) `DashboardEssay` renders UNCHANGED. These attach DIRECTLY to the existing
// `Chapter[]` spine — a route adopts ONE edge at a time (`Chapter.transition` names the edge arriving
// FROM the previous beat; `Chapter.focus` names the beat's focus effects), zero new authoring
// vocabulary beyond the two optional facets. Transcribed from the proven prototype NP1.
//
// MarkKey REUSES the selection `{kind}:{id}` codec (selection-contract) — ONE identity system for
// selection, focus, and object constancy; NO new codec (a mark that morphs A→B is the same mark the
// cross-viz highlight lifts).

/** A stable mark identity — the object-constancy key. REUSES the selection-contract codec
    (`{kind}:{id}`, e.g. `"district:920"`), so the morph keys ARE the selection keys: a mark that
    morphs A→B is the same mark the cross-viz highlight lifts. One identity system. */

// ── The transition MECHANISMS (a closed union; a route declares WHICH, never HOW) ─────────────────

/** The transition MECHANISMS — a closed union, each owned by the director. Every mechanism is
    scrub-driven (bidirectional, PRM-snappable):
      · shared-element — keyed FLIP morph through a document-space clone overlay: marks with matching
        keys travel/re-shape from A's geometry to B's (object constancy). Requires BOTH figures to
        expose a `MarkStageHandle`; falls back to crossfade when either side lacks one (declared
        intent degrades, never breaks).
      · crossfade      — A's stage recedes as B's arrives on the same scrub.
      · wipe           — a directional reveal (axis-aware; the D2 scroll-in vocabulary reused).
      · scrub-handoff  — A's exit clock FEEDS a named entry stage of B's reveal register, so B's
        draw-in begins exactly as A releases (`stage` is the named reveal segment id). */

// ── The declarative FOCUS EFFECT (the Closeread-class archetype vocabulary) ───────────────────────

/** A beat's declarative FOCUS EFFECT — fired as the beat becomes active, eased on the beat's own
    entry scrub, reversed on scroll-up. Focus effects are DATA the director interprets against the
    beat's `MarkStageHandle`; a figure never hand-wires them.

    THE FOCAL-STAGE MOTION ARM (O-A17 · the map-primacy focus grammar) — `pan` + `scale` are the two
    Closeread camera moves the full-stage sticky map answers to on its narrate beats. Both are LERPED
    on the beat's own entry scrub `t` (0 ⇒ the settled establish pose, 1 ⇒ the beat's target pose) so
    a scroll-up REWINDS them clean (bijective — NO scrolljack, the owner law). A handle honours them
    in `applyFocus(effects, t)` by composing ONE camera transform on its stage; omit the arm and the
    prior `highlight | isolate | zoom | annotate` grammar is byte-identical. */

        centre in NORMALIZED stage coords (0..1 of the stage box; omit an axis ⇒ hold it). The handle
        lerps the current centre → `to` on `t`, so scroll-up pans back to origin (bijective). */
    | { kind: "pan"; to: { x?: number; y?: number } }
    /** SCALE — zoom the stage about `origin` (normalized 0..1, default centre {0.5,0.5}) by `factor`
        at full `t` (t=0 ⇒ 1×, t=1 ⇒ factor×; the lerp is bijective so scroll-up rewinds clean). A
        camera scale about a focal point, distinct from `zoom` (which re-domains the data scales). */

// ── The morph-participation seam (the D5 no-overfit law at the motion grain) ──────────────────────

/** The visual endpoint a morph clone interpolates toward — a CSS fill (interpolated in OKLab) + the
    corner radius (`rx`: a bar is rx≈2, a dot is rx=r, so the rect↔circle morph is a pure rx/w/h lerp).

    THE FLIGHT-INK FIDELITY FIELDS (N5 consult · the pole hand-off law). A settled canvas mark is
    typically painted at partial `opacity` with a hairline `stroke` rim; a clone that flies OPAQUE and
    UNRIMMED steps the whole cloud's ink-weight in ONE frame at both poles — a visible "changing
    clothes" blink on the very object whose constancy the morph exists to hold. A handle that reports
    its RENDERED ink (the same values its option builder paints) makes the hand-off invisible on the
    object itself. All three are optional — omitted ⇒ the prior opaque/rimless clone, byte-identical. */
