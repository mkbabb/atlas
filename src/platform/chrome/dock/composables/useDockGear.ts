// useDockGear — the dock's MOBILE-GEAR posture register (J-DOCK §approach-2/§6 · C23).
//
// The 2026-06-20 live review named the phone-register defect by hand: at 390px the rail
// stacks the crest + the Roman beats + the year-range toggle + the ⤓-save door + the filter
// pull-out + the dark-toggle foot ALL inline on a 72px column — four discrete secondary
// affordances on the most-starved viewport. The user asked for "a general GEAR icon on mobile
// that encapsulates dark mode + the other items" (J-FEEDBACK-2 §1).
//
// This composable owns the gear POSTURE — it does NOT hand-roll a popover (the gear sheet
// consumes glass-ui's `DropdownMenu` + `DockDropdownTrigger` disclosure, DockSettings.vue) and
// it does NOT re-author the four controls' STATE (that stays J-ARCH's `useDockDataState`; the
// gear sheet merely RENDERS those affordances). Three reactive scalars only:
//   (a) the gear disclosure open ref (`gearOpen`),
//   (b) the chip-gating (`showChip = selectionCount > 0`, §approach-1 — the chip and the gear
//       share the foot register, so the gate co-locates here),
//   (c) the `@media(--phone)` register read (`isPhone`, via J-MOBILE's `useMobileRegister` —
//       CONSUMED, never a second breakpoint seam; the breakpoint-DRY co-touch is a READ).
//
// THE FILTERVIEW OPENER (J-FEEDBACK-4 §2/§9 — the C24 sel-chip's surviving form). Iteration-4
// settles what the SHOWN chip DOES: it is the dock-native TRIGGER that raises J-FILTER's
// filter-view facility, NOT a passive `N selected` readout. J-FILTER owns the facility BODY +
// its open singleton; J-DOCK owns ONLY the opener trigger. Until J-FILTER lands its own
// singleton, the opener consumes the EXISTING ONE-open-truth filter seam (`useFilterPane().open`,
// `Dock.vue` §A4) — the same `open` the dock filter pull-out flips — so there is ONE open
// mechanism, no second fork (the J-FILTER re-point is a single ref swap when its singleton lands).
