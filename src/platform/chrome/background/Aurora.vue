// Aurora — a THIN glass-ui <Aurora> consumer (C.W6.a Scope 2; fd-atmosphere-suffusion §3
// AS-1). It is the WebGL painterly field behind every DATA surface: one canvas the dock,
// the floating filter, and the resting plates all read THROUGH, the page-glow that fills
// the dark-on-dark voids so a dark instrument never bottoms out to flat black.
//
// THE RE-POINT (the AT-1 root-fix). This component used to be two CSS radial-gradient
// blooms (filter:blur(40px), a 38s autonomous CSS drift) — a NET DECREASE in glass-ui
// suffusion vs the deployed WebGL field, and (fatally) a field with NO `config` to push,
// so the W5 Tide could not couple to it. It is now the canonical consumer: it computes
// nothing of the shader itself — its only job is to choose WHICH surface's poles the field
// derives from and hand glass-ui's <Aurora> the pole-derived reactive AuroraConfig.
//
// POLE-DERIVED, PER DASHBOARD (FD6 §5.2; N.WD2 §4.D2 the ruled departure). The config comes from
// useAuroraConfig, which derives the 5-stop palette + the 2+2+1 nuclei ENTIRELY from the route's
// DECLARED atmosphere poles (or its theme chrome legs — the D6 default) through the canonical OKLab
// matrix (oklab.ts — the B3.1 root-fix; NEVER value.js mixColorsN), so page-glow IS data-glow. The
// hardcoded three-slug switch is DELETED: the poles are declared on the instance context, resolved
// late through the EXISTING resolveColorsBatch bridge. A mount with no context — a BRAND surface (a
// `/c/*` category home; the home cover when it wears the aurora family) or SSR/an unknown route —
// takes its poles from the `theme` prop the A-25 brand ladder builds (`skin/brand.ts`), and only a
// surface that offers NO pole source at all reaches the NEUTRAL paper wash. Never USF's tide (the
// deliberate D2.5 delta — an unknown route never wears the fund's directional currents).
//
// THE f(p) TIDE rides LIVE (C6's Aurora-`p` BIND close obligation). useAuroraConfig reads
// C5's useDocumentScrollProgress() and lerps the nuclei y / valueBias against it; the push
// is glass-ui's reactive-config deep-watch (NO imperative instance.update — it ships none),
// so the field breathes with the real scroll and reverses on scroll-up.
//
// THE CEILING — the felt-but-DEFT compositing envelope, now OWNED by useAuroraConfig (J-CLOSE
// re-gate · arm b · REBALANCED O-DIR-4 ARM 2, see useAuroraConfig.ts for the full account).
// `opacityCeiling` is the OUTER compositing envelope glass-ui applies uniformly to the canvas AND
// the CSS placeholder (via `--aurora-opacity-ceiling`): the maximum opacity the whole aurora
// surface ever composites at. The PRIOR 0.10/0.12 clamp read as fully invisible at rest (the
// owner's O-DIR-4 complaint); lifted 3× to 0.30 light / 0.36 dark, paired with the ARM 4 dock
// opacity raise so the SAME dock-plate bleed the prior clamp guarded against stays closed at the
// new, brighter envelope (the two levers move together — see Dock.css `--glass-opacity-dock`).
//
// THE O-F2 CSS-BAKED DEFAULT (idle-burn fix 1 of 3; motion-arch §2.1 MOVE 1 · §2.4 · §4.2). The field
// no longer runs a per-frame WebGPU program to paint a subliminal wash. `render-mode` DEFAULTS to
// `"css"`: glass-ui paints the SAME pole-derived pigment as a stack of radial-gradients positioned at
// the `useAuroraConfig` nuclei x/y (`auroraFallbackGround(config)`) — 0 live WebGPU contexts, 0 present
// loop, 0 `writeBuffer` on scroll, near-zero idle. The Tide (nuclei `y` lerp on `p`) survives at parity:
// the config stays reactive, so a scroll re-lays the CSS radial-gradient stops on the compositor with NO
// GPU frame — the same breath, off the shader. At the 0.30/0.36 ceiling behind opaque data plates the
// dropped fBm warp stays imperceptible (motion-arch §2.1 "on killing WebGPU"), so this is a visual
// parity, not a downgrade. WebGPU stays OFF the default path for ANY route; the `shader` prop is the
// explicit HIGH-TIER opt-in (a future hero/brand moment) that arms `render-mode="webgl"` — never
// ambient chrome.
//
// STALE-SPEC NOTE (the TREE governs): the wave + motion-arch premise that `render-mode="auto"` degrades
// to CSS on low-power/PRM/save-data is OUTDATED — glass-ui's BC.W-VIZ-AURORA (T1) RETIRED those falls;
// `"auto"` now arms WebGL on EVERY capable device (only a detected software rasteriser falls to css). So
// the CSS default is set EXPLICITLY as `"css"`, not reached through `"auto"`. Reduced-motion is carried
// by the O-F4 belt (`useAtmosphereActivity`) + glass-ui's live `matchMedia` freeze on the opt-in path.
//
// THE PER-SURFACE COMPOSITED TABLE (one ceiling per theme, O-DIR-4 ARM 2 REBALANCED):
//   surface  ceiling(L)  ceiling(D)   note
//   USF/SCI/  .30         .36          the diverging/rainbow data ground — was .10/.12 (invisible
//   ECF                                at rest); lifted 3× so the field is felt, paired with the
//                                      ARM 4 dock-opacity raise. The ceiling is per-THEME (dark
//                                      stock absorbs more) and lives in useAuroraConfig now. What
//                                      differs per route is the DECLARED
//                                      DEPOSITION (N.WD2 §4.D2 — the atmosphere facet's
//                                      granulation/breath/huePath + warm-current elongation, clamped
//                                      to the D6 envelope), riding the SAME PAPER_WASH_GROUND crayon
//                                      floor (MOVE 1) — many GROUNDS, one ceiling.

// scalar alone cannot reach, WITHOUT touching glass-ui. The last frame stays composited (a frozen
// wash, never cleared), so the idle park is graceful, not a vanish. `watchPostEffect` runs after the
// DOM flush so the template ref is live, and re-runs only when `active` (or the ref) changes.
//
// O-F2 COMPOSITION: on the CSS default path there is NO present loop to park, so `pause()`/`resume()`
