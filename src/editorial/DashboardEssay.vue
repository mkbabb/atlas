// platform/editorial/DashboardEssay.vue — THE DECLARATIVE-ESSAY HOST (I3.a · the beat scaffold, once).
//
// LIFTED (N.WB3 · §4.B3) out of the instance `src/dashboards/` into `platform/editorial/` so the essay
// ASSEMBLER is publishable beside the vocabulary it composes (`@atlas/core/editorial` now carries BOTH
// the Beat/DashboardHero/AnimatedRule vocabulary AND this one assembler). Its type dep re-points at the
// core contract (`@/contract`), never `@/dashboards` — the L1 inversion fence holds.
//
// The body becomes DATA. A route declares its narrative as a `Chapter[]` in `context.ts`; THIS
// host iterates it and renders the FULL beat scaffold ONCE per chapter — the `section-anchor beat`
// wrapper (via the shared <Beat> shell), the <FigureInitial> drop-cap, the eyebrow (icon · Roman ·
// kicker, SM-1 data-hue), the <h2> title (a plain string OR a live VNode — <HandMark> /
// <ScrollLetteringHeading> — rendered identically), the dek, the chapter viz, and the trailing
// <AnimatedRule> whose `:seed` cadence the host derives from the chapter INDEX (the SM-1/`:seed`
// drift folds — the cadence is a function of position, never hand-incremented per body).
//
// THIS IS THE SINGLE SCAFFOLD the three bodies (usf/sci/ecf) collapse onto (I3 §2 / Hard Gate 1):
// the per-beat `<section ref>` + `useScrollScene` + `beatStyle()` + the eyebrow icon + the Roman
// number + the dek that was hand-copied 6–9 times per body lives ONCE here. The bodies stop
// re-spelling it; they declare the chapters and mount `<DashboardEssay :chapters>`.
//
// THE VIZ SEAM (I3 §1, the I2 contract CONSUMED): a chapter's `viz` is a feature-plate Component
// (the plate owns its own <VizPlate>/contract, the way the bodies mount `<FundLedgerFlow />`), a
// declared `VizContract` (the host renders it through <VizPlate>, the E8 PlateVoid routing through
// `isEmpty()`), or a `"hero"`/`"colophon"` page-level sentinel. The host never re-mints the I2
// contract — it consumes it.
//
// N.WB3 · THE PAGE-FACETS (colophon + cover-figures as DATA): a `"hero"` chapter MAY carry a declared
// `hero` facet (title · dek · HeroFigure[] crown series) the host renders through <DashboardHero>, and
// a `"colophon"` chapter MAY carry a declared `colophon` facet the host renders through <SiteColophon>
// — the hand-built cover/foot become DATA the host renders, exactly as it already renders the beats.
// A chapter that declares NEITHER falls back to the body's `#hero`/`#colophon` slot (byte-identical to
// every un-migrated route), so the facet is a widening, not a break (the `EditorialChapter` seam).
//
// THE REVEAL CLOCK (the F6.3 single-writer law, T6): the native `view()` engine (scroll-driven.css)
// OWNS the fade+lift on the compositor whenever it is present — the host emits NO inline style on
// that path (the <Beat> markup is the host, the CSS is the writer). The JS reveal is the
// `@supports` fallback ONLY (Firefox / jsdom / SSR); its `style` is empty under native or PRM. So
// the reveal binding mounts ONCE per chapter without two clocks fighting.
//
// J-SCROLL §7 — the chapter reveal is now a `kind:"reveal"` FACET of the ONE clock, NOT a second
// `useScrollScene` rAF/geometry scene. `useScrollScene` retires: each chapter subscribes to the
// THIN page-clock subscriber (`useSectionReveal`, the light section-windowed 0..1 reader — one
// geometry read, no second scroll listener), and the host emits the fade+lift INLINE style ONLY on
// the @supports fallback path (`!supportsViewTimeline()`), empty under native or PRM (the
// single-writer law, T6 — the compositor is the sole writer under native; the beat is SET under
// PRM). The @supports fallback is thus the timeline's terminal `seek(1)`-equivalent: ONE reveal
// engine on ONE clock. (Phase-A SHAPE: subscribes to each section's own scroll position; on the
// Phase-C re-pin the source re-seats onto the BC `useScrollTrigger` page-reader — a one-line swap.)

    <!-- The essay iterates the chapters and scaffolds each beat ONCE. The page cover (`viz:"hero"`)
         + the colophon (`viz:"colophon"`) chapters scaffold through the SAME loop, surfacing the
         body's `#hero`/`#colophon` slot in place of a plate — so the cover/foot are chapters too,
         not bespoke `<section>`s the body re-spells.

         J-CLOSE · THE COVER IS A LEAD BEAT (the ≤0.1 CLS LAW — the figure-mount root). The `:lift`
         default below resolves the COVER (`viz:"hero"`) to `lift:false`, so the cover renders as a
         `.beat--lead` (Beat.vue) — EXEMPT from the interior beat's `content-visibility:auto` +
         `contain-intrinsic-size: auto 720px` placeholder. Without this the cover (which carries NO
         `reveal.lift` in any route's context.ts) fell to the `?? true` interior default and reserved
         the generic 720px box at first paint, then COLLAPSED to its real ~301px height when its
         content laid out — pulling the entire below-cover column UP ~419px (the live trace's dominant
         demand-desktop CLS, `cover h:720→301`). The cover is the above-fold page crown: it is ALWAYS
         visible (it never earns the below-fold render-skip) and fades IN PLACE (the lead's load-
         anchored draw), so a lead beat is its CORRECT register — the exemption is semantic, not a
         CLS hack. A route may still force `reveal.lift` explicitly; this only changes the default. -->
